# Extract-Load-and-Analyze

## Objective: 
The primary objective of this Extract and Load (EL) project is to efficiently extract data from an AWS RDS PostgreSQL database, perform minimal data transformation, and load it into Google BigQuery. The project aims to support analysis needs and fulfill business requirements using the small dataset that was generated by myself. Subsequently, the analysis is conducted using SQL in BigQuery, and the results are visualized using Looker Studio.

## Tools and Technology Used:
- __Cloud Service:__ * AWS (RDS for PostgreSQL)
                     * Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery)
                     * Google cloud Storage
- __Programming Language:__ Python
- __Database Connectivity:__ psycopg2 (Python library for PostgreSQL)
- __Data Processing:__ * Pandas for minimal data transformation
                       * SQL (for analysis in BigQuery)
- __Visualization:__   * Looker Studio
